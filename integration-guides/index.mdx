Our platform offers two integration methods: **API integration** and **Widget integration**.  
Both provide full access to onramp/offramp flows, but they differ in complexity, flexibility, and time-to-market.

---

### Widget Integration (Plug & Play)

The widget is the fastest way to get started.  
- **Setup**: Add your API key + [desired query parameters](widget-integration/supported-query-params) to our hosted widget URL.  
- **Implementation**: Simply embed the widget in your app or website via iframe â€” no backend development required.  
- **Customization**: Limited to widget configuration options (themes, supported currencies, cryptocurrencies, and payment methods).  
- **Transaction Tracking**: Subscribe to webhooks to receive status updates for onramp and offramp transactions.  
- **Best For**: Teams that want a **low-code, quick launch solution** with minimal integration overhead.

### API Integration (Full Control)

The API offers maximum flexibility and control.  
- **Setup**: Use your API key to call our REST endpoints directly.  
- **Implementation**: Requires backend integration to handle requests, authentication, and webhook events.  
- **Customization**: Complete control over the user flow, UI/UX, supported assets, and payment methods.  
- **Transaction Tracking**: Webhooks and polling endpoints provide fine-grained visibility into transaction lifecycles.  
- **Best For**: Teams that need **deep integration** into existing products, advanced workflows, or custom UI.

### Choosing the Right Method

- Choose **Widget Integration** if speed, simplicity, and plug-and-play deployment are your priorities.  
- Choose **API Integration** if you need full flexibility, custom user experiences, or complex business logic.  

Both methods provide webhook support for reliable transaction status updates, so you can start simple and migrate to API later as your product needs grow.
