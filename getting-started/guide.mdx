# Onboarding Guide

Welcome to our platform! This guide will walk you through the steps required to get started, from setting up your account to generating your first API key.

## The Terminal (Partner Portal)

The **Terminal** is your central dashboard for managing your account information. From the terminal, you can manage:  
- your business profile 
- team members 
- mark up fees 
- API credentials 
- monitor transctions on your account 
- and so much more

## To get started

<Steps>
<Step title="Create a Partner Account">
Sign up on the [Terminal](https://orki-money.vercel.app/app) to create your partner account.  
</Step>

<Step title="Start Free Trial">
All new accounts come with a **14-day free trial**.  
This allows you to explore the dashboard and begin the onboarding process before committing to a subscription. 

</Step>

<Step title="Submit KYB Information">
To comply with regulations, you’ll need to submit your **Know Your Business (KYB)** documentation.  
This step is required before you can access production APIs.  

Your application will be reviewed within a few business days.  
You can track the review status directly from the dashboard.
</Step>

<Step title="Complete Business Profile">
Navigate to:  
`Profile & Settings > Business`  

Fill out all required business details, including:  
- Business name 
- Business Email
- Website
- Registered address  
- Business type   
- Contact details  

Completing this section is mandatory for verification.
</Step>

<Step title="Generate API Keys">
Once your KYB application has been approved and your business profile is complete, head to:  
`API Management`  

Here you’ll be able to generate and manage your API keys.

<Warning>
  The **API Keys section remains locked** until all prior steps (account creation, KYB submission, and business profile completion) are complete.
</Warning>

</Step>

</Steps>
