## Customizing Your Widget

### Customization Options

From the Dashboard, you can adjust:

- **Brand Colors**  
  Define your primary and secondary colors to match your visual identity.

- **Buttons**  
  Customize your button colors.

- **Layout & Containers**  
  Control the widget’s overall feel which includes card, border and container styles to fit different screen sizes and embedding contexts.

- **Advanced Options**  
  Fine-tune details like typography, border radius, shadow style.

### Why Customize?

- Aligns with your brand’s design system  
- Improves user trust and recognition  
- It allows the widget to feel more native inside your product

All changes saved in the Dashboard are applied across all widget instances.
